A small game on iPads for small kids - specifically made for autistic kids
The game supports language development by continuous repetition of single words and need for action. Basically, the kis sees images on the screen and needs to move the right one to the empty picture frame. With the first levels, where there is only one image and the empty picture frame, the kid learns the word and connects this with intended movement. Later, the kid identifies in a collection of images the right one by the sound of the item.
